# Stegosaurus_CPP_Implementation
A C++ implementation of Stegosaurus, an image manipulation app that can encode text into the RGB values of pixels.

# Compatibility
Stegosaurus has been tested and developed to work with PNG files without any issues.

This version of Stegosaurus is not compatible with the python version, this is because it uses a different method for encoding and decoding which would result in a different message being displayed if attempting cross-compatibility. With this being said, maintaining the use of each program within its own isolation, will work completely fine.

This implementation is still under development and has been created to demostrate my capabilities at learning C++.
