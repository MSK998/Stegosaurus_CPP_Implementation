# Stegosaurus_CPP_Implementation
A C++ implementation of Stegosaurus, an image manipulation app that can encode text into the RGB values of pixels.

#Compatibility
Stegosaurus has been tested and developed to work with PNG files without any issues.

This implementation is still under development and has been created to demostrate my capabilities at learning C++.
